Oracle Data Dictionary 

The Oracle data dictionary is one of the most important components of the Oracle DBMS. 
It contains all information about the structures and objects of the database such as tables, 
columns, users, data files etc. The data stored in the data dictionary are also often called 
metadata. Although it is usually the domain of database administrators (DBAs), the data 
dictionary is a valuable source of information for end users and developers. The data dictionary 
consists of two levels: the internal level contains all base tables that are used by the various 
DBMS software components and they are normally not accessible by end users. The external 
level provides numerous views on these base tables to access information about objects and 
structures at different levels of detail. 

3.1 Data Dictionary Tables 
An installation of an Oracle database always includes the creation of three standard Oracle 
users: 

• SYS: This is the owner of all data dictionary tables and views. This user has the highest 
privileges to manage objects and structures of an Oracle database such as creating new 
users. 
• SYSTEM: is the owner of tables used by different tools such SQL*Forms, SQL*Reports etc. 
This user has less privileges than SYS. 
• PUBLIC: This is a “dummy” user in an Oracle database. All privileges assigned to this 
user are automatically assigned to all users known in the database. 
The tables and views provided by the data dictionary contain information about 

• users and their privileges, 
• tables, table columns and their data types, integrity constraints, indexes, 
• statistics about tables and indexes used by the optimizer, 
• privileges granted on database objects, 
• storage structures of the database. 
The SQL command 

select * from DICTIONARY]; 

lists all tables and views of the data dictionary that are accessible to the user. The selected 
information includes the name and a short description of each table and view. Before issuing 
this query, check the column definitions of DICTIONARY] using desc DICTIONARY] and set 
the appropriate values for column using the format command. 

The query 

select * from TAB; 

retrieves the names of all tables owned by the user who issues this command. The query 

select * from COL; 

returns all information about the columns of one’s own tables. 

Each SQL query requires various internal accesses to the tables and views of the data dictionary. 
Since the data dictionary itself consists of tables, Oracle has to generate numerous SQL 
statements to check whether the SQL command issued by a user is correct and can be executed. 

Example: The SQL query 

select * from EMP 
where SAL > 2000; 

requires a verification whether (1) the table EMP exists, (2) the user has the privilege to access 
this table, (3) the column SAL is defined for this table etc. 

3.2 Data Dictionary Views 
The external level of the data dictionary provides users a front end to access information 
relevant to the users. This level provides numerous views (in Oracle7 approximately 540) 
that represent (a portion of the) data from the base tables in a readable and understandable 
manner. These views can be used in SQL queries just like normal tables. 

The views provided by the data dictionary are divided into three groups: USER, ALL,and DBA. 
The group name builds the prefix for each view name. For some views, there are associated 
synonyms as given in brackets below. 

• USER : Tuples in the USER views contain information about objects owned by the account 
performing the SQL query (current user) 

USER_TABLES all tables with their name, number of columns, storage 
information, statistical information etc. (TABS) 

USER_CATALOG tables, views, and synonyms (CAT) 

USER_COL COMMENTS comments on columns 

USER_CONSTRAINTS constraint definitions for tables 

USER_INDEXES all information about indexes created for tables (IND) 

USER_OBJECTS all database objects owned by the user (OBJ) 

USER_TAB_COLUMNS columns of the tables and views owned by the user (COLS)
 
USER_TAB_COMMENTS comments on tables and views 

USER_TRIGGERS triggers defined by the user 

USER_USERS information about the current user 

USER_VIEWS views defined by the user 

• ALL : Rows in the ALL views include rows of the USER views and all information about 
objects that are accessible to the current user. The structure of these views is analogous 
to the structure of the USER views. 

ALL_CATALOG owner, name and type of all accessible tables, views, and 
synonyms 

ALL_TABLES owner and name of all accessible tables 

ALL_OBJECTS owner, type, and name of accessible database objects 

ALL_TRIGGERS . . . 

ALL_USERS . . . 

ALL_VIEWS . . . 


• DBA : The DBA views encompass information about all database objects, regardless of the 
owner. Only users with DBA privileges can access these views. 

DBA_TABLES tables of all users in the database 

DBA_CATALOG tables, views, and synonyms defined in the database 

DBA_OBJECTS objects of all users 

DBA_DATA_FILES information about data files 

DBA_USERS information about all users known in the database
