indexing exercise
 
In your account:
 
1) create a large emp table as follows:
 
create table empbig as select * from emp;
 
2) enlarge empbig with:
 
insert into empbig select * from empbig;
 
repeat this statement until 1792 rows are inserted into 
empbig. this will result in a  table having 3584 rows.
 
3) Add a new col to the table:
 
alter table empbig
add seqid number(5);
 
4) Populate this new column with a sequence of unique values 
with:
 
update empbig
set seqid = rownum;
 
(rownum is an Oracle specific keyword which, when used in this way,  simply adds a unique number to each row of the table).

5) commit your values simply by typing

commit

at the SQL prompt.
 
6) set up for taking timing statistics with:
 
set timing on.

(note no semi-colon at the end of this statement as it is an sqlplus statement (Oracle specific)).

This will report the execution time each time you execute a query.
 
7) Make a note of the the reported cpu times for the following queries:
 
select the empno with seqid = 1000

8) select empnos with seqid > 3000
  
9) Increase values of seqid by 5000 for rows having seqid >
2000

10) select empnos with seqid > 3000
   
11) create a unique index on seqid
 
12) repeat steps 7 to 10, contrasting the time for each operation now supported with a unique index with the first time through when no index was present.

Continue to examine the effect on timings of selecting and updating greater proportions of the table in the presence of an index.
